There are bugs in the Matlab JIT compiler that may prevent the code
working correctly. Setup.m will turn off the JIT compiler if it
detects a bug.

Setup also adds Taylan Cemgils' graphlayout package and Mark Schmidt's minFunc package (http://www.di.ens.fr/~mschmidt/Software/minFunc.html) to the path.
